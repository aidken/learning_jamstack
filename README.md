Learning [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) and a Next.js Website, based on a tutorial [here](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app).

## Note February 14th 2021
Wrote a tutorial website. Tried to deploy at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), but it could not build it.

I read tutorial that is written by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and then deploy it at Netlify. If I am not familiar, I should have tried it at Vercel.

Anyways, both services reads a [Github](https://github.com/aidken) repo, builds, and serves. They seem to run npm. From this, I can say they are hosts and run a build script. A build script can be a Javascript, a Python script.

I want to connect my app to a database. If Netlify and Vercel can read only public repos, that would be a problem. I cannot credentials in a public repo.

[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) has many site generators, template apps which I can edit. Can deploy at Netlify instantly.
